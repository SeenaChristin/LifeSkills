According to the Feyman Technique, you can learn a complex concept by trying to explain it in the simplest manner, as if explaining it to a child.

The most interesting idea for me was that we have the power to train our brains to think and process in new ways.

**Question 3**
### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
1. In active mode, our brain is focused on the problem and trying to find a solution with the help of previous experience and memory.
2. In diffused mode, the brain is relaxed and may be thinking about a problem, which might help the brain come up with creative solutions to an unsolved problem.


**Question 4**
### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
1. Deconstruct the skill
2. Learn enough to self-correct
3. Remove practice barriers
4. Practice at least 20hours

**Question 5**
### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
I would try to use the Pomodoro technique to switch my brain from active to diffuse modes in order to get more work done.
For learning totally new concepts, I would try the 20-hour technique.
